## Agenda Creation Instructions for teleconferences

This needs to be done by end of day on the Friday before the call so that we can decide if the call is going ahead and notify attendees.

Wizard: https://iw-agenda-generator.glitch.me/

By hand:

Copy and rename the template in `/meetings/wg/template.md` to `/meetings/wg/[date]-[call type]-agenda.md`

e.g. `/meetings/wg/25-09-2018-telecom-call-agenda.md`

Find [open issues assigned to the spec editors](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aimmersive-web+assignee%3Atoji+assignee%3ANellWaliczek+state%3Aopen&unscoped_q=repo%3Aimmersive-web+assignee%3Atoji+assignee%3ANellWaliczek+state%3Aopen) look back through the issue to find a recent summary of the issue. If there is not a recent summary then ask for one.

Delete the section containing the instructions.

Email a copy of the agenda out to the [mailing list](mailto:public-immersive-web@w3.org) making sure to link back to the agenda markdown file on github.

After the call the Minutes minutes should be added to the Agenda.md by adding a link.

so that there is a permanent record of meetings and their accompanying agendas.
