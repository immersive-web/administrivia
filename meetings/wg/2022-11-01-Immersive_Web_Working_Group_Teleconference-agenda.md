* [navigation#3 Next steps for Navigation](https://github.com/immersive-web/navigation/issues/3) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/navigation/issues/3#issuecomment-1276689984)

> I hooked up this API as an experiment and the experience is much nicer than what we have today: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hNAj5gL7m60
>We recently shipped planes and I've had to tell many people that they need to go to settings to get the planes to work. It will be much better if the experience itself can trigger this
> add API to trigger room setup

* [real-world-geometry#36 Add support for semantic labels](https://github.com/immersive-web/real-world-geometry/pull/36) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/real-world-geometry/pull/36#issuecomment-1294065200)

* [anchors#79 Allow a limit of the number of active and persistent anchors](https://github.com/immersive-web/anchors/issues/79) - cabanier
> Currently the spec does not mention any limit to the number of anchors a site can create.
 >On Quest, there is a significant additional load if a lot of anchors are active so we like to limit how many can be in a scene at a time.

* [administrivia#190 Front-facing camera in AR - incubation](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/issues/190) [requested by bialpio](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/issues/190#issuecomment-1276762881)
