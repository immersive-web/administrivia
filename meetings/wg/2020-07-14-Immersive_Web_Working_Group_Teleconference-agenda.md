* WebXR Working Draft
* [hit-test#66 Can "point" just be subsumed into "mesh"?](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test/issues/66) [requested by blairmacintyre](https://github.com/immersive-web/hit-test/issues/66#issuecomment-651376365)
> need to revisit this, especially as ARKit has again expanded the range of possibilities and this is too restrictive.

* [layers#174 getSubImage / getViewSubImage need to be called every frame](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/174) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/174#issuecomment-657000428)
> What should be the behavior of the color and depth textures?

* [layers#175 Should spatial audio work in media layers?](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/175) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/175#issuecomment-657000220)
> Should spatial audio work in media layers?

* [webxr#997 What should we do about hand input sources where "select" and "squeeze" are confusable?](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/997) [requested by Manishearth](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/997#issuecomment-656825335)
> to discuss this with stakeholders present
>
>@mrdoob @RaananW @thetuvix @cabanier @Artyom17 Would y'all be able to make it to next week's call (12PM PST Tuesday). I'd like to discuss this with all of you present. @mrdoob and @RaananW if y'all don't have connection info for the call please email me (manish@mozilla.com) or otherwise contact a group member to share it with you.

>A thing I do think is worth noting is that while "hand input sources only expose select" is suboptimal it's not _terrible_, code might need to be tweaked to use select for local interaction as well.
>
>@thetuvix @cabanier it would also be nice to know if it's at all possible for the platform to expose distinct select/squeeze guestures, as well. I know this might go against platform conventions, but it's worth exploring.
