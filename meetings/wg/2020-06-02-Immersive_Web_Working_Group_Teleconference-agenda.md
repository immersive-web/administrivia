* [webxr-ar-module#53 Global environment blend mode does not work with "third eye" video capture views](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/issues/53) [requested by Manishearth](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-ar-module/issues/53#issuecomment-636097435)
> to discuss the general space here

* [administrivia#98 Move Layers to WG](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/issues/98) - Yonet
> Let's discuss if it's time to move Layers to Working Group from Community Group.

* [layers#148 Bring the layers spec into the Working Group](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/148) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/148#issuecomment-635583987)
> Can the layers spec move to the WG? Can we produce the FPWD?

* [webxr#674 Should requestReferenceSpace() wait until getViewerPose() won't be null?](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/674) [requested by Manishearth](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/674#issuecomment-636093725)
> to discuss the choice between #1068 and #1070 for this
>
>This has been discussed a couple times already and I _think_ folks in general prefer #1070, but I just want to have a quick check in a call

* [webxr#1051 Difficulty with multiprocess implementation of updateRenderState](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1051) [requested by toji](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1051#issuecomment-636089095)
> to ask if it's appropriate to move when `updateRenderState()` changes are applied.
>
>I recall that there was quite a bit of discussion about this timing when we first added `updateRenderState()`, and I don't recall why we landed on the currently pattern aside from a general sense that it would be more intuitive for the users. I think there's ample reason on the implementation side to change when it applies though and would like to reconsider it as a group.
