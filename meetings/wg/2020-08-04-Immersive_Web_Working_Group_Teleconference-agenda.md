* [webxr-hand-input#37 Have a joint set object that lets you fetch all joint poses at once](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-hand-input/issues/37) - Manishearth
> During discussion of https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-hand-input/pull/32 in today's call it seemed like while everyone wanted to solve the problem of ~200 objects being created per frame, folks didn't want to cache XRJointPoses because it would be unexpected.
