If you would like to add an item to the agenda or volunteer to scribe please open a pull request against this agenda.

* [real-world-geometry#38 Add support for 3D geometry](https://github.com/immersive-web/real-world-geometry/issues/38) [requested by AdaRoseCannon](https://github.com/immersive-web/real-world-geometry/issues/38#issuecomment-1477519085)
> Quest room setup allows for the creation of 3D objects and we'd like to expose those like we do for planes.
 >For future proofing, I think we can expose them as meshes (like we do for planes). I believe Hololens already has APIs to expose the real world this way.

* [webxr#1316 Enable foregrounding of 2D browser](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1316) [requested by AdaRoseCannon](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1316#issuecomment-1477518130)
> How useful would it be to show the 2D browser while in WebXR?
 >Quest Pro added the ability to bring up the browser while the user is in an immersive game. Would it make sense to allow this while in WebXR? What are the pitfalls? (ie should it show all tabs or only the active one)

* [webxr#1317 Some WebXR Implementations pause the 2D browser page in XR, make this optional?](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1317) - AdaRoseCannon
> Some WebXR Implementations pause the 2D browser page in WebXR, this is a performance improvement and is technically correct since the page isn't visible. Unfortunately it can cause issues if you are tying bits of your WebGL scene to DOM based animations and transitions. The ability to opt out of this behaviour would be handy for developers.
