* [layers#135 Depth testing across layers](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/135) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/135#issuecomment-921973984)
> We're thinking off adding this feature to the platform because it solves some of the drawbacks of having depth separation between the layers. It seems that on the specification side, it could just be a feature that is requested a session creation time.
>
> Discuss interest in depth sorting between layers

* [webxr#1217 Add XRFrame.predictedDisplayTime](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/pull/1217) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/pull/1217#issuecomment-918458154)
> Also, what should be the "start" time? Should it match the document session start like the one that is passed to requestAnimationFrame?
> discuss review comments on XRFrame.predictedDisplayTime

* [webxr#1223 (Re) consider isSessionSupported query for required features.](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1223) [requested by AdaRoseCannon](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/1223#issuecomment-924134561)
> requested by Nick from 8th Wall (@nbutko)
