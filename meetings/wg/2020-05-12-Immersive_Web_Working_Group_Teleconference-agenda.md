* [webxr#674 Should requestReferenceSpace() wait until getViewerPose() won't be null?](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/674) [requested by toji](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/674#issuecomment-625929786)
> to try and clear out some of the older pre-CR issues.

* [webxr#743 Allow sensitive UI to make use of the `visible-blurred` state](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/743) [requested by Manishearth](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues/743#issuecomment-625932705)
> So a lot has changed since this issue was filed. We do have a more concrete concept of trusted UI.
>
>_Currently_, the spec says:
>
>> The ability to read input information (head pose, input pose, etc) poses a risk to the integrity of trusted UI as the page may use this information to snoop on the choices made by the user while interacting with the trusted UI. To prevent this risk the user agent MUST set the visibility state of all XRSessions to "hidden" when the user is interacting with trusted UI (immersive or non-immersive) such as URL bars or system dialogs. 
>
>This would essentially involve allowing visible-blurred in this paragraph, which allows for head pose (and no input) to be read.
>
> Are we okay with applications knowing head poses (and head poses only) while displaying trusted UI?
