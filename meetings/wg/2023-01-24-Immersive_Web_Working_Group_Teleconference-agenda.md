* [layers#298 Add option to skip the clearing of textures](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/298) - cabanier
> The WebXR layers spec [defines](https://immersive-web.github.io/layers/#opaque-texture) that the textures that are returned from the binding are always cleared to opaque black.
 >This feature is hard to implement without incurring GPU overhead especially when dealing with multiple layers.

* [layers#299 Remove chromaticAberrationCorrection option](https://github.com/immersive-web/layers/issues/299) - cabanier
> As far as I know, no experience has ever used this feature and it is not even hooked up in the browser anymore as OpenXR doesn't support it.
