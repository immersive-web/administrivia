* [depth-sensing#50 Add XRView to XRDepthInformation](https://github.com/immersive-web/depth-sensing/pull/50) [requested by cabanier](https://github.com/immersive-web/depth-sensing/pull/50#issuecomment-2386524454)
> discuss adding an optional feature that accomodates slower depth refresh rate

* [model-element#102 Model extraction?](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/102) [requested by zachernuk](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/102#issuecomment-2574084526)

>I think this is a valuable capability to pursue anytime spatial content has a strong reason to be situated in space, and at a true (human-scale) size. Even with no other capabilities, that includes commerce, the heritage sector, data visualization and engineering applications.
>
>While it's true that WebXR has the ability to meet these needs, it's through a totally separate track of work that cannot reuse other web capabilities directly, and the privacy risks you mention are significant enough that it's not necessarily _desirable_ for it to be the de-facto way to address them without a really compelling reason.

>Finally, `<model>` as it is proposed today isn't the end goal. As always, the challenge with spatial content is how to bring progressively more spatial capability _into_ the existing taxonomy of web without falling off a cliff of irreducible complexity.
