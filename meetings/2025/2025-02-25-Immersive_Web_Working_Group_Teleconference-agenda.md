* [model-element#108 How to force a background color to fully opaque?](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/108) [requested by AdaRoseCannon](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/108#issuecomment-2679328250)
> As we've discussed, a stereoscopically-rendered model probably shouldn't have a transparent background. Given that this is specified by CSS, what do we do with colors that are transparent? Is it better to ignore the alpha value and use the RGB as-is, or should it be multiplied down in some manner by the alpha?

* [model-element#25 Define interactivity?](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/25) requested by zachernuk
> Further discussion has led us to stagemode="orbit", which I think makes sense - a further question is how much to specify the behavior of the manipulation scheme. on visionOS, the Quick Look behavior allows for 'pitch' and 'heading' on drag, and then zeroes the 'pitch' on release, leaving only the 'heading' rotation preserved. It seems like a reasonable conceptual frame of reference to pursue.
> 
> The question is: Is that a subject of standardization, or is it a good place to leave room for UAs to implement as they see fit?
