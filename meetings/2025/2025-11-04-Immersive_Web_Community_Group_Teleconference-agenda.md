* [model-element#129 Rejecting stateful model content](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/129) - zachernuk
> Some 3D resources have encoding of stateful behavior - e.g. the [glTF Interactivity proposal](https://www.khronos.org/blog/gltf-interactivity-specification-released-for-public-comment) and the now-defunct (but still honored) `Preliminary_Action` API introduced in Reality Composer 2019.

* [model-element#130 What role, if any, should `poster` play?](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/130) - zachernuk
> I'm personally concerned that `poster` is under-specified for the things that an author will want to do to represent a `<model>`. First, the syntax doesn't allow for alternative file formats, for different resolutions or aspect ratios or `prefers-color-scheme` etc. Add to that the possibility that a good poster/placeholder for a `model` element _may even be another model_, and it makes me wonder whether there's an appropriate way to meet these needs at all. What does everyone else think?
