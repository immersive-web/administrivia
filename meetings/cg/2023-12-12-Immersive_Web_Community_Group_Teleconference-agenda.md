* [model-element#70 Need for Planning and Justification](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/70) [requested by DR-xR](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/70#issuecomment-1811261098)
> This repo has been around for almost 2 years and very little progress has been made, even to the point of not having a plan to be able to complete or close the work here. It wasn't until this last TPAC that a justification for creating a new element was provided. There still are a lot of open issues on rendering and basic handling. There is a new one on making the entire structure modern-web compatible (#73).
>
>I am not looking to resolve all issues soon, but to develop a plan whereby all of the issues can be addressed. The initial comment for this issue is not the only way to proceed. The WG/CG should develop a means for getting to the end of this so any browser builder can address the need described in this repo in a consistent and standard manner.
