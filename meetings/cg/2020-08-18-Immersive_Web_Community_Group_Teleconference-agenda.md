* [administrivia#125 FaceMesh Extraction Explainer](https://github.com/immersive-web/administrivia/issues/125) - alcooper91
> I've recently created an Explainer for what an API to extract a FaceMesh from a camera stream that can be rendered to/over would look like. While my current proposal is that it **not** (at first) integrate with WebXR (and thus would likely be promoted to the WICG rather than here if/when it is ready), I know that the topic is of interest to people in this CG, so I wanted to mention it and share a pointer during the next CG call.
