* [capture#2 Port explainer from initial proposal](https://github.com/immersive-web/capture/pull/2) [requested by AdaRoseCannon](https://github.com/immersive-web/capture/pull/2#issuecomment-1743404009)
> to bring to attention of the group

* [model-element#71 Supply an Image-based Light file](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/71) [requested by zachernuk](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/71#issuecomment-1765096806)
> At TPAC we agreed that specifying an image-based light (IBL) is an important component of a V1 implementation and specification. In addition to the specific name (environment map, lighting environment, IBL etc), there is the matter of _structural_ representation, i.e. how it  resides within the tree structure of the `<model>` markup itself.

* [model-element#72 Specify a camera's pivot location](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/72) [requested by zachernuk](https://github.com/immersive-web/model-element/issues/72#issuecomment-1765096452)
> At TPAC we discussed the necessity to point the view into a `<model>` element at specific locations within it, e.g. to focus on specific features of a car.
